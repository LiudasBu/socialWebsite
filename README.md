## VIKO EIF 2020

A basic social website with an ability to perform CRUD operations on posts, made with PHP Laravel

Profiles can be accesed by the path */profile/{user_id}*


From there we can go on to create posts:

When the post is open we can edit it if we are logged in as the user that made it, as well as delete it if logged in as admin, also there is a possibility to search for the definition of words using the Merriam-Webster dictionary API. Obviously since it only gives one definition it can often be not the right one.
